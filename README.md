# Gizmo Scanner

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimal Python tool that checks scanned codes against a text file and plays a sound for matches

## Info

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks for the first .txt file in the same folder

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waits for input (Scan the item!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the code matches a line in the file → plays sounds/yes.mp3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not → plays sounds/no.mp3

## Notes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires ```pygame```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One item code per line in the .txt file

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will warn if no .txt files are found
